EE584 - Machine Vision Course Homeworks------------

HW2: on Calibration--------------------------------
Parameterss of the webcam is detected and its accuracy is increased by increasing the image number.

HW8: on Segmentation-------------------------------
K-means segmentation is applied.

HW11: on Projective Geometry Homography------------
Calibration pattern is used to measue the length of an object

HW 12: on Structure from Multi-view----------------
The effect of SGM parameters, DisparityRange and UniquenessThreshold is analyzed.

HW 13: on Structure from Multi-view----------------
Q1: 3D structure from 2 views captured is found.
Q2: The trajectory of camera is found.

HW 14: on Learning-based techniques----------------
'Semantic Segmentation of Multispectral Images Using Deep Learning' example in MATLAB is executed.
However, semantic segmentaion is performed by test data instead of valid data.
